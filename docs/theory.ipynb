    "# Least-square conformal map directly applied to nurbs surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A use case of least square conformal maps is the mapping of mesh (triangle-surface) to a flat plane. This is normally used for textureing meshes. Given the fact that the lest-square conformal map can produce the exact flattened surface for developable surface we try to perform the lscm method on spline-surfaces to optain a unwrapped representation of the nurbs-surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a collocation method should be use to solve for conformity on nurbs surfaces. If this works for developable surfaces the extension to a weighted least-square method will be explored.\n",
